We use MATLAB because the following reasons:
1. we have to use *something* for examples;
2. it's well-documented;
3. it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists in academia and industry; and
4. it has a large library of packages available for performing diverse tasks.
5. it is free and open source software driven by community
